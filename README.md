# NC-News

## Front End React Application

NC-News is a [Reddit](www.reddit.com) - esque social news aggregator.

NC-News displays articles, which are catgorized by topic. Each article has a rating which users can choose to up or down vote. Users can also add and delete their own comments to an article, as well as create new articles and topics entirely.

A live version of this project can be found [here.](https://5bc9c8263813f06d2fec9f73--aah-nc-news.netlify.com/)

This front end application uses a RESTful API that I have created as part of a previous project. More details of this project can be found [here.](https://nc-news-aah.herokuapp.com)

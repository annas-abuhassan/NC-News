Readme is obviously W.I.P (soz)

hosted link =>

## please don't break anything

things i want to implement:

=> improve the show more button on the navbar for topics
=> some kind of sort on the topics in the nav bar, to order by most popular / most recent
=> some kind of sort of the article list, to order by most popular / most recent
=> make use of the users endpoint! Make each user a link to their own profile page, didn't see this as a priority.

=> generally improve formatting all round, (especially the login component i feel this could be made a lot nicer..)
=> i also don't like how things shift when i make votes on article comments...

=> also i have made no accomodation for mobile viewers and potentially i have some accessibility things i need to fix.. soz x2
